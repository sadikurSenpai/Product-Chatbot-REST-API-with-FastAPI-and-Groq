# Product-Chatbot-REST-API-with-FastAPI-and-Groq
This project implements a fully functional, RAG-style (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot REST API using FastAPI. It is designed to interact with customers, intelligently answering queries about product details by leveraging data from the DummyJSON Products API and generating human-like responses using the Groq LLM API.
